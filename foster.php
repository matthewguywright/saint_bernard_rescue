    	<h2>Foster Care</h2>
        <p>Saint Bernards brought into foster care should receive basic training as far as good house manners and obedience are concerned. Sit, Stay, No, No jumping and Go Outside should be part of the dog's "vocabulary" before he/she leaves foster care. Learning to walk on a leash should be accomplished - if a basic obedience class is started, all the better. Dogs should be introduced to the crate in needed. Identification tags should be on the dogs at all times - tags are available through Al or Sabrina Wright.</p>
        <p>Foster homes should try to socialize the dog in as many situations as possible, as long as common sense and good judgments are utilized. Any problems should be addressed with Al or Sabrina Wright.</p>
        <p>While in foster care, the dog will need to be groomed and exercised as necessary. A good quality food will need to be provided.</p>
        <p>Common sense and caution should be used when introducing the Saint to new people, children, dogs and other pets as well as to new situations. It's not a bad idea to keep the Saint on a lead in the home for the first few days until you get a good idea of his/her personality and temperament.</p>
        <p>The foster Saint will be on a lead at all times in unfenced areas.</p>
        <p>When potential adoptive parents come to meet the dog, careful observation of the people involved will help you determine if they would be a good match for the dog. Discuss all the good and BAD aspects of Saint ownership. Especially with regards to that particular Saint's quirks and personality.</p>
        <p>Fostering is generally a very positive experience, and you responsible actions will result in the placement of many dogs that would otherwise be destroyed.</p>
