    	<h2>Surrendering Your Saint</h2>
        <p>Re-homing a Saint Bernard is an arduous process, and not all Saints are eligible for our Rescue. Please be aware that since we only take Saints into private foster homes, we are limited on the number of intakes we can do at any given time. It is not unusual to have a month or longer wait list for incoming Saints. Also, upon surrendering your Saint to us, we may or may not require a fee for spay/neuters and/or vaccinations. Please send the following information to <a href="mailto:asawright13@aol.com">asawright13@aol.com</a>.</p>

		<h3>Placeability</h3>
        <p class="bold">For a Saint Bernard to be placed by our program, it must be considered a placeable animal. While it is our goal to place as many Saint Bernards into homes as possible, we do not want to place dogs with poor or aggressive temperaments, or serious or chronic health problems. We cannot take the moral or ethical responsibility of placing a dog that may be either a danger to, or a financial burden to, a new family.</p>
        <p>All dogs accepted into the program MUST be approved by the rescue coordinator/president. (Note: If a Saint Bernard is accepted into the program and determined to be un adoptable, it will be euthanised.)</p>
        <h3>To be considered placeable, the dog must meet the following criteria:</h3>
        	<ul>
            	<li>
            	  <p>To have a good, stable temperament. Dogs that are overly aggressive, known biters, or have other serious temperament problems will not be accepted into the program for placement. If the dog is not accepted due to temperament, it is strongly suggested that the releasing party be made fully aware of the implied liability in their placement of a problem dog. Solutions should be offered to the releasing home, ranging from training to euthinasia. A vicious dog should never be placed into a new home.</p>
            	</li>
                <li>
                  <p>All dogs accepted into the program must be Saint Bernards (subject to space availability).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Be in acceptable condition. As a guideline, a dog will be considered placeable if it can be returned to a normal condition and maintain a normal life and life span through proper care and feeding, and if a medical condition can be corrected for a reasonable cost.</p>
