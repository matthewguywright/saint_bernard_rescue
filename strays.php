    	<h2>Found Dogs, Strays</h2>
        <p class="bold">Saint Bernards that have been found by an individual party, or roaming as strays, or are abandoned may not be accepted directly into the program. These dogs shall be handled as follows:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li><p>If appropriate, the representative may capture a loose-roaming or stray dog whose ownership is unknown. It must then be turned in to a local animal shelter or animal control agency, and that shelters and counties policies must be adhered to. When the stray hold has been lifted, the shelter may, at their discretion, release the dog to NE/IA Saint Bernard Rescue.</p></li>
            <li>
              <p>If a dog is reported as abandoned, the representative shall contact the proper animal control agency within that county and must follow their guidelines. After any holds have been lifted the dog may be released to NE/IA Saint Bernard Rescue.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Any strays or abandoned dogs accepted into the program must have the appropriate releases from the shelter completed and placed in their files.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="bold">Note: It is VERY important that these procedures are followed. Strays and abandoned dogs can only be accepted directly from shelters and animal control agencies after the appropriate holds and paperwork have been completed. There can be serious legal ramifications if these procedures are not followed.</p>
