    	<h2>Adoption</h2>
        <p class="bold">Saint Bernard Lover,</p>
        <p class="bold">By giving an orphan a new "LEASH" on life, you give them a chance to show you how wonderful they are. Most of all, you show them just how wonderful YOU are. The following will explain the adoption process and national guidelines for adoption.</p>
        <h3>National guidelines for adopting a Saint Bernard are:</h3>
        <ul>
        	<li><p>To be part of the family and considered a family member.</p></li>
            <li><p>A fenced yard so your Saint can play at his leisure and self-exercise. No electric fencing. They do not work with Saints.</p></li>
            <li><p>Home checks are done prior to placing the Saint with their new family.</p></li>
            <li><p>The new family must agree to keep their new Saint current on heartworm preventative in accordance with their vets advice.</p></li>
            <li><p>You must be able to understand the nutritional needs of a giant breed and be willing/able to accomodate their dietary needs.</p></li>
            <li><p>All current pets in the home must be spayed/neutered prior to placement of the adopted Saint.</p></li>
            <li><p>The new family must agree to keep current identification on their new Saint at all times.</p></li>
            <li><p>The new family must sign an Adoption Application and Adoption Contract.</p></li>
            <li><p>The new family must be willing to pay the adoption fee.</p></li>
            <li><p>Some knowledge of giant breeds (not required) is a plus.</p></li>
            <li><p>If you are a renter, you will need to include a letter from your landlord stating that it is ok to have a Saint. The letter will need to have the landlord's address and phone number on it.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our Adoption Fee is $275.00, which all goes back into Rescue for medical and other expenses.</p>
